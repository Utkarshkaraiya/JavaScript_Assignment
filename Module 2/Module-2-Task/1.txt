// Difference between Object and Map

Object: A data structure in which data is stored as key value pairs.
 In an object the key has to be a number, string, or symbol. 
 The value can be anything so also other objects, functions etc. 
 A object is an non ordered data structure, i.e. the sequence of 
 insertion of key value pairs is not remembered.


E Map: A data structure in which data is stored as key value pairs. In which a unique key maps to a value.
 Both the key and the value can be in any data type. A map is a iterable data structure, this means that the
 sequence of insertion is remembered and that we can access the elements in e.g. a for..of loop
Key differences:

A Map is ordered and iterable, whereas a objects is not ordered and not iterable

We can put any type of data as a Map key, whereas objects can only have a number, string, or symbol as a key.

A Map inherits from Map.prototype. This offers all sorts of utility functions and properties which makes working with Map objects a lot easier.
