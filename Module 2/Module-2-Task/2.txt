// Difference between regular functions and arrow functions
Arrow function — also called fat arrow function— is a new feature introduced in ES6 that is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions.
 While both regular JavaScript functions and arrow functions work in a similar manner, there are certain differences between them.
//Example
 // ES5
var add = function(x, y) {
  return x + y;
};
// ES6
let add = (x, y) => { return x + y };

Following are the main differences:
-Syntax
-Arguments binding
-Use of this keyword
-Using a new keyword
-No duplicate named parameters
